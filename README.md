  <p>
    WeatherApp is a simple and very useful weather app written in React using the OpenWeatherMap API. It is a great tool for users who want to quickly and easily get information about the current weather conditions in a selected location.
All the user needs to do to get weather information is to type in the city and click a button.
The application returns a message if the name of the city is incorrect, and has a loader that runs while the application waits for the server to respond.
